        <b>1   INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING                          1
        </b>
            CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
            hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
            hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded
            zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years
            of use, hangs loosely around his neck.
        
            WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
            mouth. Almost forming a smile.
        
            He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
            African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
            cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
            in front of her.
        
            She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
            to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.
        
            Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.
        
            Beat.
        
        <b>                        JOKER
        </b>              --is it just me, or is it getting
                      crazier out there?
        
            Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
            Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.
        
        <b>                         SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>              It's certainly tense. People are
                      upset, they're struggling. Looking
                      for work. The garbage strike seems
                      like it's been going on forever.
                      These are tough times.
                          (then)
                      How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
                      enjoying it?
        
        <b>                          JOKER
        </b>              Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
                      day, so   I really like that. I don't
                      think I   could ever work in an
                      office.   Behind a desk.

                  No offense.
        
        She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's
        running late for her next appointment.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Have you been keeping up with your
                  journal?
        
        <b>                       JOKER

        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Great. Did you bring it with you?
        
        Beat.
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>              (dodging the subject)
                  I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>              (impatient; she doesn't
                       have time for this)
                  Arthur, last time I asked you to
                  bring your journal with you. For
                  these appointments. Do you have it?
        
        <b>                       JOKER
        </b>          Yes ma'am.
        
        Beat.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Can I see it?
        
        He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered
        notebook. Slides it across to her--
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          I've been using it as a journal,
                  but also a joke diary. Funny
                  thoughts or, or observations-- Did
                  I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
                  stand-up comedy?
        
        She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          No. You didn't.
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          I think I did.
        <b>                                                            3.
        </b>
        
        She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Oh yeah. Because of what your
                  mother said,-- about your purpose.
                  "To bring laughter and joy to the
                  world," right?
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          Right.
        
        ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,
        angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore
        pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.
        
        A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at
        his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.
        His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          I didn't realize you wanted to read
                  it.
        
        The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in
        the pages that gives her pause.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>              (reading out loud)
                  "I just hope my death makes more
                  sense than my life."
        
        She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out
        there for a beat.
        
        Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
        funny--
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          Yeah. I mean, that's just--
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Does my reading it upset you?
        
        He leans in.
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          No. I just,-- some of it's
                  personal. You know?
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          I understand. I just want to make
                  sure you're keeping up with it.
        
        She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
        <b>                                                         4.

        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          What about your mom? How's she
                  feeling?
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          She has good days. But mostly bad.
                  It's been a big help having me
                  there. She really needs me.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Seems like she's been sick a lot
                  since you got home.
        
        <b>                     JOKER
        </b>              (nods)
                  Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
                  was in the hospital, after my last
                  episode-- she was having trouble
                  getting over there to visit.
        
        She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next
        appointment.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          All right. So, I'll see you again,
                  two weeks from today?
        
        He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.
        
        She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Is there something else I can help
                  you with, Arthur? My next
                  appointment is waiting.
        
        He just keeps sitting there.
        
        <b>                    JOKER
        </b>          Yeah, I was wondering if you could
                  ask the doctor to increase the
                  dosage on my medications? Nothing
                  seems to make a difference.
        
        <b>                     SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>              (looking over his record)
                  Do you know which ones you'd like
                  increased?
        
        Shakes his head, no.
        
        <b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>          Have you been sleeping?
        <b>                                                              5.

                      Some.
        
            She glances at his file again.
        
        <b>                        SOCIAL WORKER
        </b>              Arthur, you're on seven different
                      medications. Surely they must be
                      doing something.
        
            He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.
        
            Looks at her--
        
        <b>                        JOKER
