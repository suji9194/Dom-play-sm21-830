        CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his <br>eyes from laughing so
        hard.<br> He's trying to get it under control.<br> His greasy, black
        hair is matted down.<br> He's wearing an old, faded red hooded<br>
        zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare<br> gray scarf, thin from years<br>
        of use, hangs loosely around his neck.<br>
            
        </br>
            WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS <br>cut at the corners of his
            mouth.<br> Almost forming a smile.<br>

        <br>He's sitting across from an <br>overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
            African American.<br> Her office is cramped and run-down in<br> a
            cramped and run-down building.<br> Stacks of folders piled high
            in front of her.</br>

        <br>She just sits behind her desk, <br>waiting for his laughing fit
            to end, she's been <br>through this before. Finally it subsides.<br>
            Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.</span></p>
            Beat.</br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong>
        </br></span>
        <br> --is it just me, or is it getting
               crazier out there?<br>
        
        <br>Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.<br>
            Something broken in him. <br>Looks like he hasn't slept in days.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong>
        </br></span><br>It's certainly tense.<br> People are
                      upset, they're struggling.<br> Looking
                      for work.<br> The garbage strike seems
                      like it's been<br> going on forever.<br>
                      These are tough times.<br>
                       <br>   (then)</br>
                     <br> How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
                      enjoying it?<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong>
        </br></span>
                <br>Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
                      day, so   I really like that.<br> I don't
                      think I   could ever work in an
                      office. Behind a desk.<br>
                                (MORE)<br>
    <span><br><strong> JOKER (CONT'D) </strong><br></span>
                 <br>(beat)<br>
                    No offense.
        
        <br>She smiles. Writes something down.<br> Looks at the clock, she's
        running late for her next appointment.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>Have you been keeping up with your
                  journal?<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                 <br>Everyday.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                  <br>Great. Did you bring it with you?<br>
                    Beat.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                    <br>(dodging the subject)<br>
                  I'm sorry. Did I bring what?<br>
        
    <span><br><strong>  SOCIAL WORKER   </strong><br></span>
                        <br> (impatient; she doesn't
                       have time for this)<br>
                        Arthur, last time I asked you to
                        bring your journal with you. <br>For
                        these appointments.<br> Do you have it?<br>
        
    <span><br><strong>  JOKER  </strong><br></span>
                  <br>Yes ma'am.<br>
        
                        Beat.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>Can I see it? <br>
        
                <br>He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered
                    notebook.<br> Slides it across to her--<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
               <br> I've been using it as a journal,<br>
                  but also a joke diary.<br> Funny
                  thoughts or, or observations-- Did<br>
                  I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
                  stand-up comedy?<br>
                  She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>No.<br> You didn't.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER  </strong><br></span>
                <br> I think I did.<br>
        
                <br> She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--<br>

    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER   </strong><br></span>
               <br>  Oh yeah. Because of what your
                  mother said,-- about your purpose.<br>
                  <br>"To bring laughter and joy to the
                  world," right?<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER  </strong><br></span>
                <br>  Right.<br>
        
                <br> ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes,<br> all in neat,
                    angry-looking handwriting. <br>Also, cut out photos from hardcore
                    pornographic <br>magazines and some crude handmade drawings.<br>
                    A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. <br>We see him picking at
                    his right eyebrow, almost obsessively.<br> Trying to stay calm.
                    His eyebrow is actually half-gone. <br>Something he does a lot.<br>
                    
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> I didn't realize you wanted to read
                  it.<br>
        
                    The social worker gives him a look,<br> then reads something in
                    the pages that gives her pause.<br>
     
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                    <br>  (reading out loud)<br>
                    <br> "I just hope my death makes more
                        sense than my life."<br>
        
                    <br>She looks up at Joker. <br>He just stares back.<br> Lets it hang out
                        there for a beat.<br>
        
                    <br>Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
                        funny--<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                    <br>  Yeah. I mean, that's just--<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>Does my reading it upset you?<br>
        
                <br>He leans in.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>   No. I just,-- some of it's
                  personal.<br> You know?
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                 <br> I understand. <br>I just want to make
                  sure you're keeping up with it.<br>
        
                <br> She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>  What about your mom? How's she
                  feeling?<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> She has good days. But mostly bad.<br>
                  It's been a big help having me
                  there.<br> She really needs me.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>  Seems like she's been sick a lot
                  since you got home.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> (nods)<br>
                  Yeah, it's good I'm there. <br>When I
                  was in the hospital, after my last
                  episode--<br> she was having trouble
                  getting over there to visit.<br>
        
                <br>She looks back up at the clock, <br>she needs to get to her next
                    appointment.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> All right.<br> So, I'll see you again,
                  two weeks from today?
        
                <br>He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.
        
                <br> She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--<br>
        
    <span><br><strong>    SOCIAL WORKER  </strong><br></span>
                <br>  Is there something else I can help<br>
                  you with, Arthur? My next
                  appointment is waiting.<br>
        
                <br>He just keeps sitting there.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong>  JOKER  </strong><br></span>
                <br> Yeah, I was wondering if you could
                 <br> ask the doctor to increase the
                  dosage on my medications?<br> Nothing
                  seems to make a difference.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br>  (looking over his record)<br>
                    Do you know which ones you'd like
                    increased?<br>
        
                    Shakes his head, no.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> Have you been sleeping?<br>
       
    <span><br><strong> JOKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> (lying)
                    Some.<br>
        
                     She glances at his file again.<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> SOCIAL WORKER </strong><br></span>
                <br> Arthur, you're on seven different
                      medications. <br>Surely they must be
                      doing something.<br>
        
                    He finally stands up. <br>Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.
        
                    Looks at her--<br>
        
    <span><br><strong> JOKER  </strong><br></span>
                <br>  I just don't wanna feel so bad
                     nymore.<br>
